# Jane Doe

It is expected that all team members leverage their coursework from CS471 to
create good user stories in a role-goal-benefit format, a set of
tasks, and well written Definition of Done (DOD) criteria. Do not take
this example as a license to write a one sentence user story or a one sentence
time estimation method.

## User Story

As a user of my schools Learning management system (LMS) I need to be
able to add remove and update students in my class so I can keep my
roster up to date.

## Tasks

1. I will author the Model class for a Student in the system to store
  their Name, Id, Major, year, email, and list of classes they have
  taken.
2. TODO:
3. TODO:
4. TODO:
5. TODO:

### Time estimation method

The team used planning poker to estimate that each of my tasks is roughly
8 hours of work.

## Definition of Done

- Task 1 DOD - I will know that I am done by having a set of unit/system tests that
  exercise my Model class. I can run my tests with the test.sh script and see the results
  of the tests. My tests are ran on every commit with the results shown at https://github.com/example
- Task 2 DOD - TODO:
- Task 3 DOD - TODO:
- Task 4 DOD - TODO:
- Task 5 DOD - TODO:
