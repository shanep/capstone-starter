## Additional Guidelines

- While I am not against crass language and feel that some situations warrant it (like smashing your thumb with a hammer),
  I don't think that crass language should be included in your team contract. If you are not aware of what crass language
  is then please schedule some office hours and we can review some examples.  Your team contract should be G rated :)
- It is fine to say things like "we have talked as a group and will not have a grade reduction policy" This is great!
  Remember this contract is for YOUR team not me, if you all feel comfortable you can structure your contract however
  you wish!
- You must check your contract into your repository. You can't use google docs or other online editors.
