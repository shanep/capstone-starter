## Week 1

This was syllabus week all work was done in class.

## Week 2

John Doe skipped out on the meeting today because he said it was international underwater basket weavers
day and he had to attend a mandatory safety briefing to keep his basket weaving license. According to
John, underwater basket weaving accidents are the number one cause of death for people between
the ages of 19 and 21.5 years old so if he missed the meeting it could literally kill him!!

The rest of the team and I finished reviewing all the requirements for this week and discussed how
to separate out all the work. This is going to be a great semester ðŸ˜Ž.
