# Work Journals

Teams are required to meet each week to review progress. You are given class time each week to
work and meet so there should be no scheduling issues. Each team member must create a weekly
work journal using the template provided in the starter repository. There is an example in
your groups repository to help guide you. Each entry **must be in its own file** as shown in
the examples do not merge entries into one large file!

The content of the work journal can be whatever the student feels is appropriate for the current
week. You can write about your team meeting, what was talked about during lecture or code that you
wrote or are going to write. You can reference commits or artifacts in the repository to help
illustrate what you accomplished. Read through the document [mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
for tips on how to make your documents fancy ðŸŽ©  <-- fancy people wear tophats!

Journals are intended to be short documents of at least 100 words or more that capture what you are working on
over time. Work journals can't be **backdated** so if you miss a week you can't make it up the following week.
Students are responsible for ensuring their work is committed and pushed to the teams git repository.
No credit will be given for journals that were completed but not pushed.

You are **NOT REQUIRED** to have a journal over Spring or Thanksgiving Break!

## Example Grade calculation

Assuming a journal entry worth 10 points you would calculate your grade as follows:

| Criterion  | Level      | Points  | Weight | Total |
|------------|------------|---------|--------|-------|
| Word Count | Apprentice | 10 * .9 | .7     | 6.3   |
| Format     | Expert     | 10 * .1 | 1      | 1     |
|            |            |         |        |       |
| **TOTAL**  |            |         |        | 7.3   |
